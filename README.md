# Musescore-Downloader
Ever wanted to play your favorite song on a new instrument you are trying to learn, searched for the song, and wanted to download it from Musescore only to get scammed 50 bucks? Well, not anymore! With the Musescore downloader, you can download any song along with midi (for you fl studio nerds) you wish.

I think your antivirus will get mad because the program involves reading, creating, and removing files.
Download at your own risk if someone makes a fork of this for whatever reason and you download from that fork instead.
